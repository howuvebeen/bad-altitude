<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Project

Due to COVID-19 pandemic, people long for oversea trips. They miss the beautiful ocean and deviation from the routine. However, what comes first? The boring flight or memorable trip? This game humorously addresses the boredom in long flights and reminds people with the forgotten pain that always comes before they go on vacation.  

This is the personal project I am working on. It's currently in developing process. 
Detailed information will be updated shortly in this document.

## Built With

* Unity

## Rules
Win
* Balance mood status appropriately until the end of the flight

Tips
* Only using the fun items is not enough to endure the entire flight
* Only using the boring items results in the mood status hitting zero 
* The mood status decreases slowly over time but it decreases faster once the mood is closer to zero
