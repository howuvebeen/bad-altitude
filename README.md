<h2 align="center">Bad Altitude</h2>

<p align="center">
<strong>Bad Altitude is a 2D strategy game in which the player tactically balances between boring his friend to sleep and making him more fun during their flight.</strong>
<br />
<br />
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, people long for oversea trips. They miss the beautiful ocean and deviation from the routine. 
<br />
However, what comes first? The boring flight or memorable trip? This game humorously addresses the boredom in long flights and reminds people with the forgotten pain that always comes before they go on vacation.
